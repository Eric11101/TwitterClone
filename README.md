# Reflection


# How your website accomplished each item in the criteria.
## - Where could the concepts discussed in class be seen in your website?

The program incorporates the concepts from Essential HTML tags, CSS styling, Animations, DOM manipulation, and API integration. Each of these key elements contributes to the overall functionality, aesthetics, and interactivity of the program.

## - What was your inspiration for the design of the website?

As evident, our website drew inspiration from X, a prominent and widely-used social network platform. This inspiration provided a solid foundation for our project, guiding us towards creating a website that seamlessly combines user-friendly elements and engaging aesthetics.

Beyond this foundational inspiration, the true magic unfolded through the collaborative efforts of our team members. Each individual brought unique perspectives and innovative ideas to the table, collectively shaping the animations and transitions that define our project. The synergy of diverse thoughts and creative inputs played a crucial role in elevating the overall user experience.


## - What was your approach in creating the content of the website?

Alson, head of our group, played a vital role in laying the foundation of our program. His visionary leadership initiated the important aspects of our project, enabling us to foresee potential outcomes of the design and funcationalities.

With the collaborative effort of every member, we embarked on the integral journey to our success. Rosales, with expertise in API and user interaction, played a crucial role in shaping our program. Cruz and Macandog significantly contributed to enhancing the aesthetic and functional aspects of our HTML and CSS.

## - How is your website creative?

Our website stands out for its creativity, especially when it comes to animation and attributes. We incorporate dynamic animations that not only enhance visual appeal but also contribute to a seamless and engaging interaction.

The animations on our site aren't just decorative; they serve a purpose. Whether it's a subtle hover effect and the transition between pages element has been thoughtfully designed to elevate the overall user experience.

## - What did you use to deploy your website?

Utilizing tools like Visual Studio Code, Github, and Netlify proved were valuable in compiling the collaborative contributions of everyone involved.


# How you worked as a team to accomplish the project

## - How did you divide the tasks between the team, and what is the responsibility of each one?

We were assigned tasks based on our individual capabilities. For instance, if the design lacked animation or didn't meet aesthetic standards, Alson took the initiative to either personally address the issue or delegate the task to a team member with the expertise to enhance it. This approach ensured that each aspect of the project received attention from the team member best suited to elevate its quality.

## - How did you prevent your changes in code from conflicting with each other?

Based on our experience, we've created multiple repositories in response to conflicts arising from changes in the code. To prevent such issues, we make it a practice to notify everyone before pushing any changes, ensuring that the entire team is informed about the latest updates. This communication strategy helps maintain transparency and keeps everyone well-informed about any modifications made to the project.

## - How you could improve your website in the future

Mastering the DOM (Document Object Model) and API (Application Programming Interface) is an important aspect of enhancing our website's functionality, responsiveness, and overall user experience. Mastery on these concepts would empower us to manipulate the structure and content of our web pages dynamically, ensuring seamless interaction and efficient data retrieval. By exploring much more into these, we aim to implement advanced features, optimize performance, and create a more polished and user-friendly online platform in the future.
